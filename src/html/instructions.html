<h1>MetaEncryption</h1>

<h3>
    Introduction
</h3>
<p>
    Thank you for using MetaEncryption! This extension's purpose is to protect vulnerable metadata generated by your web browser's password manager. That is achieved using cryptographic libraries built in the extension, and encryption practises considered to be the industry standard, so a high level of security and performance is expected and guaranteed.

<h3>
    Changing Encryption Key
</h3>
<p>
    The extension comes with a predetermined, default key to use for encryption - for security purposes, it is highly recommended to change it to a user-specific one to ensure integrity of your data.

   <strong>
       WARNING - Ensure that anything you have previously encrypted has been decrypted back before changing your encryption key, otherwise the data will become completely inaccessible, even to its' own user.
   </strong>
